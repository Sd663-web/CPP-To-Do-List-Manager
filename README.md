# C++-To-Do-List-Manager
C++ To-Do List mini project demonstrating core programming concepts, STL vectors, modular design, and interactive console-based task management.


# 📝 C++ To-Do List Manager

A simple **console-based To-Do List application** developed in **C++** as part of the **CodeSoft Virtual Internship**. This mini project allows users to manage daily tasks efficiently by adding, viewing, completing, and removing tasks through an interactive console menu.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The To-Do List Manager is designed to strengthen core programming fundamentals while building a real-world usable application. It uses **dynamic data structures** to store tasks and provides a clean, user-friendly interface with **color-coded menus** for better readability.

---

## ✅ Features

* ➕ **Add Task** – Add new tasks dynamically
* 📋 **View Tasks** – Display all tasks with their status (**Pending / Completed**)
* ✔ **Mark Task as Completed** – Update the status of any task
* ❌ **Remove Task** – Delete tasks from the list
* 🎨 **Color-coded Console UI** – Different colors for different menu options
* 🔄 **Automatic Task Display** after adding a task

---

## 🛠 Technologies & Concepts Used

* **Language:** C++
* **STL:** `vector`, `string`
* **Programming Concepts:**

  * Functions & modular programming
  * Loops and conditional statements
  * Dynamic memory handling using vectors
* **Platform:** Windows (uses `windows.h` for console colors)

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

* Improved understanding of **C++ STL vectors**
* Learned how to manage **dynamic data** instead of static arrays
* Gained experience in **menu-driven console applications**
* Enhanced problem-solving and logical thinking skills

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* File handling to save tasks permanently
* Cross-platform color support (Linux/macOS)
* Use of `struct` or `class` for better data organization
* Task priority and due date support
